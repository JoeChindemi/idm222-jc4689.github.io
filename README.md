This is my IDM 222 Final Project - Flour + Vine Pizzeria.

This project is a multi-page website for a fake pizzeria based in Philadelphia called Flour and Vine.

The site contains three pages:  the index/homepage, the menu, and the about section.  This site incorperates concepts that were taught throught IDM 222, including responsive web design, responsive images, and animations to name a few.  The main goal for this projcet is to be accessable and visually pleasing on a number of different devices.
